# OldMacATX
ATX PSU adapter for old Macintoshes - IIcx, IIci, (IIsi? should be the same), IIvx, IIvi, P600, C/Q650, Q800, PM7100. Finally a replacement to a rewired ATX extender harness.

You'll need:
1- An ATX PSU (duh)
2- A single gate inverter in SOT-23-5 package (SN74LVC1G04DBVR or compatible)
3- A 100nF capacitor in 0805 package, rated to 10V or better, X5R dielectric or better
4- A male 20 position Molex MiniFit Jr. header, p/n 39-29-9205 or similar (or half of an ATX extender cable, or the ATX connector ripped off some old motherboard)
5- A female 10 position Molex MiniFit Jr. header, p/n 15-24-7100 or similar (or the harness from your decrepit Mac PSU)

It`s generally hand-solderable and foolproof. I'll provide JLC assembly files for at least the two SMD parts.

I am not responsible if you blow yourself or your Mac up in attempting this. These files are provided in the expectation anyone attempting to use them is sufficiently skilled to do so.
